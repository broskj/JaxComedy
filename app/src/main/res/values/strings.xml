    <string name="about_us_title">Comedy doesn\'t have to be ugly!</string>
    <string name="about_the_club">The Comedy Club of Jacksonville opened in November 2012. Focused on great service,
        delicious food, and first rate ADULT comedy WITHOUT much of the vulgarity, we are excited to offer a higher level
        of entertainment. Our comics appear on David Letterman, Jay Leno, and Comedy Central and provide a night club act
        without the fatiguing repetition of hardcore language and content. Get a Jerry Seinfeld style of show, not Jerry
        Springer. We want your genuine belly laugh, not the embarrassing "what did that person just say" shock laughter
        that is associated with a foul comic.\n\n

        Not just sometimes, but each week our Friday and Saturday shows will be rated on two levels: CONTENT
        and LANGUAGE. Language is a \"soft R\" with no F-bombs, and Content is an \"R\" with adult humor but no hardcore vulgarity
        or language.\n\n

        We hope you join us for a night of laughs that will be comfortable for dates, groups, company functions, associations,
        anniversaries, or just a fun night out. And since most of our comics have never performed live in Jacksonville before,
        we offer a refreshing variety of top national touring comics who will give you lots of belly laughs.</string>
    <string name="more_room">The Comedy Club of Jacksonville seats 300 comfortably. Our tables are bigger (because we serve great
        food) and tables are spaced with more square footage per person, unlike the cramped seating of most other comedy clubs.
        No longer do you have to sit on the lap of the person you are seated next to, but stretch out and enjoy top national
        touring artists at the Comedy Club of Jacksonville.</string>
    <string name="best_seats">Check out The Best Seats in the House. For that special occasion or just a fun night out, The Best Seats
        in the House are actual front bucket seats from a 2007 XJ8 Jaguar automobile. They are functional for a custom seat position
        plus includes your first beverage.</string>
    <string name="no_two_item_minimum">Buy a ticket and that\'s it; we do have a full kitchen with high quality food and full bar plus
        we have great prices on our items, but will not force you to buy anything as other clubs do. Our service is fast and
        convenient and we hope you indulge but feel free to sit back and enjoy the show!</string>
    <string name="online_tickets">We are also happy that buying your ticket online costs the same as buying a ticket at the door. There
        is NO service charge for buying online. It is a free service, unlike other clubs who charge a few extra dollars to buy online.</string>
    <string name="app_exclusives">Similar to buying tickets online, reserving seats through our app costs the same as buying a ticket at
        the door.  Additionally, you have access to EXCLUSIVE deals only available to those download the app, as well as regular
        updates on our weekend shows.</string>
    <string name="saving_lives">The Comedy Club of Jacksonville is excited to work with The Blood Alliance in Jacksonville. In conjunction
        with The Blood Alliance, donors from Jacksonville companies who participate in a blood drive and exceed their goal earn a
        pair of tickets to a great night of comedy. Companies are recognized during the show with a stage shout out and a \"Thank
        You\" slide on our pre-show projector slide show. It is proven that laughter can extend your life, and by donating
        blood and sharing a laugh with us you get a double shot of \"Feel Good\".</string>
