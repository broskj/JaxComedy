General:
    -In MainActivity, save spreadsheet JSON to a file and use the file to load information in onCreate.
        -populate file daily using AlarmManager (nightly, around midnight).
        -Be sure that the alarm still works if the device was turned off overnight.
    -Create classes to use common methods
        -For example, SpreadsheetContent for shows and deals from spreadsheet that has methods such
          as downloadShows, getDeals, and processJson.
    -Add checks for <1 or >200 guests in Reserve
    -Add notification when new deals are added
    -Add points when user clicks notification

Structure:
    -MainActivity -> {This Weekend, Upcoming Shows, Rewards and Offers, Food and Drink, Groups and Parties;
      Reservation, Add Reward Points, Redeem Offer}
        -This Weekend -> Reservation
            -Current information for the weekend show.  Supply information from a spreadsheet, and update
              on monday if possible.  This information will be the content of the weekly notifications, and
              the notifications will link to this page.  A video widget at the top will show a youtube video of
              the comedian.
                -Able to reserve seats from here; include a button for each show, and pass that information to
                  the reservation page.
        -UpcomingShows -> Reservation
            -format similar to calendar if possible.  Otherwise, display ordered list of dates which there
              are shows, and include information such as show time, comedian, etc.
                -Able to reserve seats from here; include a button for each show, and pass that information to
                  the reservation page.
        -Rewards and Offers -> {Add Reward Points, Redeem Offer}
            -Populate from google spreadsheet.  Each deal will contain a title, description, and point value.
              Deals come from a Rewards Program, where points are entered each visit and confirmed with a
              4-digit pass code at the door.  Redeeming a reward resets/decrements the total point value a
              certain amount.  Error message is displayed when the point value isn't high enough.  Initial point
              value set high enough for automatic access to some deal.  Include some deals with 0 point values,
              and make them unclickable or direct to information page.
                -Can have deals with point values of 0, i.e. free to all mobile users without decrementing points.
        -Food and Drink
            -Expandable list of item names and prices, with expanded text being description of item.  Mostly
              used for food items and drink specials.
        -Groups and Parties
            -Includes group/party overview with contact information for additional offers.  No reservations from
              this page.
        -Reservation
            -Activity used to select showtime/date and guest number, and to leave a reservation name.  Needs to perform
               checks on fields like name and guests (name has to be included, guests cannot be over 20) and needs to
               enable/disable dates and show times based on availability (cannot reserve seats for a sold out show, a
               show time that doesn't exist, etc.).
            -Sends email confirmation to the user (confirmation code based on random number generator?) and to
              info@jacksonvillecomedy.com, maybe to an alternate email for me as well for easier record keeping.
        -Add Reward Points
            -Reached from Rewards and Offers by clicking point value area near top.
            -Includes fields for number of tickets purchased and for a 4-digit pass code to be entered at the door.
              A confirm button checks for a correct password and if it's correctly entered, point value increments
              and saves to device.
        -Redeem Offer
            -Confirmation page.  Requires password, and pushing confirm with correct password decrements point values.
              Either needs to be presented at door or at table; deal needs to be confirmed and the customer needs
              to be given a physical coupon if presented at the door, and if presented to a waiter/waitress, deal needs
              to be confirmed and administered immediately upon confirmation (i.e., free appetizer coupon gets confirmed
              and sent through the POS during the same interaction with the customer).

MainActivity:
    -may be where all broadcast/notification events are handled.
